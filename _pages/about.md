<div class="highlight-box">
  As a bioinformatics postdoctoral researcher in translational medicine at Servier,
  <span class=important>I focus on leveraging systems biology to prioritize drug combination strategies.</span>
  My research is involved in the challenging issue of modeling biological systems and predicting behaviors under perturbations to support therapeutic solution research,
  via <span style="font-weight:bold;">biological knowledge graphs and dynamical models of biological regulations</span>.
</div>

<span class=important>I am highly motivated by the translation of fundamental research into health care advances.</span>

In particular,
<span class=important>I have a keen interest in the complex interplay between neuro/immune disorder and infectious diseases</span>, with a particular focus on **conditions characterised by persistent systemic effects** that challenge our current understanding.
I am convinced that there are exciting explorations to be carried out, given the complexity of **multisystem impacts** of this type of disorder.
They remain poorly understood at a fundamental level, leading to not only **a lack of effective therapeutic solutions** but also **limited symptomatic relief** for patients.

My fascination for this research area is twofold:
- As a citizen, it represents a pressing public health challenge with significant potential for millions of patients the society is missing out on.
- As a researcher, it leads to captivating multisystemic explorations that go beyond compartmentalized health studies. Addressing these conditions requires looking into infectiology & immunology, while studying dysfunctions that span central and peripheral neurology, gastroenterology, cardiology… and their complex interactions with metabolic alterations such as mitochondrial impairment.

<!-- I have a special affinity for the holistic approach of systems biology to explore biological phenomena.-->
<!-- During my training, I could successively approach complementary bioinformatics perspectives: the challenge of data integration, NGS analysis, structural analysis for drug design, and finally, the one of complex biological systems analysis and modelling. -->
